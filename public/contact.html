<h2>Vaibhav's message for you</h2>
<p>
  Hi there, 
  <br />
  <br />
  If you've made it this far on my website, it's likely that you're interested in what I do and are considering connecting with me. I thrive on building meaningful relationships with driven, like-minded individuals. When I say "connect," I don't just mean a casual acquaintance. I mean fostering real, impactful relationships—whether virtual or in-person—rooted in mutual appreciation and the exchange of skills, knowledge, and capabilities.
  <br />
  <br />
  I am a firm believer in Mark Granovetter's 1973 theory, "The Strength of Weak Ties." If you haven't read his paper, I highly recommend it—it's a worthwhile read. (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392">The strength of Weak Ties</a>).
  <br />
  <br />
  In essence, this enduring theory suggests that we often find greater success by forming relationships outside our immediate circles.
  <br />
  <br />
  I'm confident we can learn a great deal from each other, and I don't want to miss the opportunity to connect with you. So, since you've come this far, take one more step—choose your preferred way to connect and reach out.
  <br />
  <br />
  I look forward to connecting with you soon.
